p. 9 step 2.
adding this line after the psql call would have saved me a lot of time:
postgis_cookbook=> CREATE SCHEMA chp01;

Those new to postgreSQL would benefit greatly by going through chapter 10 first.

p. 26 step 2.
ALTER TABLE hotspots should read ALTER TABLE chp01.hotspots

p. 35 step 6.
$ psql -U me -d romerome=# CREATE EXTENSION hstore;
should be split into two lines,
$ psql -U me -d rome
rome=# CREATE EXTENSION hstore;

p. 39 step 1.
tmin_10m_bil.zip isn't used anywhere in this book.

p. 41 step 3.
tmax01.bil should read tmax1.bil

p. 52 step 3.
There should only be one instance of password='mypassword' and schema='chp01' in this script.

### chp02 ###
#############

p. 61 and 62
Why does the popgeom_insert change from a per-statement trigger to a per-row trigger in the "Extending further..." section.
Some explaination here would be helpful.

p. 68
Where is the "monolithic contour table called cuy_contours_2"?
The psql CREATE TABLE script won't work without it.

p. 78
Change all instances of geom to the_geom in the first and second code blocks.

#############
### chp03 ###
#############

p. 121 step 3.
hu_regions_topo should be hu_topo

#############
### chp05 ###
#############

p. 178 and 179
Change,
FROM prism
to
FROM chp05.prism

p. 184
Change,
SELECT DropRasterConstraints('prism', 'rast'::name);
to
SELECT DropRasterConstraints('chp05', 'prism', 'rast'::name);

### chp10 ###

p. 394 step 2.
insert
psql -d chapter10
before calling
CREATE SCHEMA postgis;
Otherwise, the schema will be applied to the default postgres database and not chapter10.

p. 396 step 10.
What is the reasoning behind copying the dataset into its own directory?
Also, suggest not using mixed unix and windows syntax for a command.

p. 399 step 3.
Why the need for
> psql -d chapter10
Should we already be in the chapter10 database (execute at the beginning of step 1)?

p. 400 step 9. 10. and 11.
After executing step 9. the \dn+ already looks like the privileges displayed in step 11.
The command in step 10, adds another privilege to the postgis schema,

                          List of schemas
  Name   |  Owner   |  Access privileges   |      Description       
---------+----------+----------------------+------------------------
 postgis | postgres | postgres=UC/postgres+| 
         |          | group1=U/postgres   +| 
         |          | group2=U/postgres   +| 
         |          | =U/postgres          | 
 public  | postgres | postgres=UC/postgres+| standard public schema
         |          | =UC/postgres         | 

Should the reader not have executed step 10? It is unclear what the reader is expected to do here.

p. 401 step 18.
change 
"the ability use the UPDATE"
to
"the ability to use the UPDATE"

p. 401 step 19.
change
psql -d chapter10 -u user3
to
psql -d chapter10 -U user3

also,
when executing,
psql -d chapter10 -U user3
psql returns,
psql: FATAL:  Peer authentication failed for user "user3"
I've experienced this in other places in this book, but I do not see it addressed anywhere.
A Note with an explanation along with some good external links would be helpful.
